# MyReads Project

This application allows you to place selected books into a designated shelf. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.
## Functionality

*  Search books against a keyword
* Add book to a shelf
* Update shelf and apply changes globally
* Remove book from shelf

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
